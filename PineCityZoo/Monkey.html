                        <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                        <p>
                        Monkeys are highly intelligent primates found in many parts of the world, 
                        from the tropical rainforests of Central and South America to the forests 
                        and savannahs of Africa and Asia. They belong to two main groups: New World 
                        monkeys, which live in the Americas, and Old World monkeys, found in Africa 
                        and Asia. Monkeys vary greatly in size, colour, and behaviour, but they are 
                        known for their agility, expressive faces, and social nature. Many species 
                        live in groups called troops and communicate through vocal sounds, facial 
                        expressions, and gestures.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Most monkeys have long tails, which some species use for balance or even 
                        grasping branches in the case of prehensile-tailed monkeys. They spend much 
                        of their time in trees, where they search for fruits, leaves, flowers, insects, 
                        and small animals. Monkeys are playful and curious, often seen swinging from 
                        branches, grooming one another, or using simple tools to gather food. Because 
                        of habitat loss and hunting, some monkey species are now endangered, making 
                        conservation efforts vital to their survival. Zoos help protect monkeys by 
                        educating visitors and supporting breeding programs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Monkeys thrive in forests, woodlands, and jungle canopies with plenty of trees and food sources.
                        </p>

                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the monkeys at pen M11, close to the tropical forest trail.</p>
