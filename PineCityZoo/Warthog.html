                        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                        <p>
                            Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found across the savannahs and 
                            grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa. They are easily recognised by their large 
                            curved tusks, flat snouts, and facial “warts,” which are actually protective 
                            pads. Warthogs spend much of their time grazing on grasses, roots, berries, 
                            and bark, often kneeling on their front knees to dig for food with their snouts. 
                            They are diurnal and rely on speed and burrows to escape predators like lions 
                            and leopards. Warthogs use abandoned aardvark holes for shelter and protection.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Both male and female warthogs have tusks, which they use for digging, fighting, 
                            and self-defense. They live in family groups called sounders, usually consisting 
                            of females and their young, while males are more solitary. Warthogs are surprisingly 
                            fast and can reach speeds of up to 50 km/h when threatened. Despite their tough 
                            appearance, they have playful personalities and are known to run with their tails 
                            pointed straight up as a signal to other warthogs. They play an important role in 
                            the ecosystem by aerating the soil as they dig for food.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Warthogs prefer open grasslands, savannahs, and lightly wooded areas near water.

                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the warthogs at pen W07, near the African plains trail.</p>
