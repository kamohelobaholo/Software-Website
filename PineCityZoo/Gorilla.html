                        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                        <p>
Gorillas are the largest living primates and are members of the great ape family. 
They live in dense forests and mountain regions of central Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Gorillas are highly social animals that live in groups called troops, led by a 
dominant silverback male who protects and guides the group. They have broad chests, 
massive shoulders, and strong arms for climbing and foraging. Gorillas are primarily 
herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and occasionally insects.
</p>

<p>
Despite their powerful build, gorillas are gentle and intelligent creatures that 
communicate through vocalisations, facial expressions, and body language. Mothers 
are highly nurturing and care for their young for several years. Gorillas spend 
much of their day foraging and resting in family groups. Sadly, gorillas face 
threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and disease, making conservation vital 
to their survival. Zoos play an important role in raising awareness and protecting 
these remarkable animals.
</p>

<p>
Gorillas prefer tropical and subtropical forests and mountainous regions with thick cover.

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas at pen G13, near the rainforest dome trail.</p>
