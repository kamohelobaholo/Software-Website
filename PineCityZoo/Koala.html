                        <h3>KOALA</h3>
                        <p>
                            Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia and are easily recognised 
                            by their round, fluffy ears, large noses, and thick grey fur. They spend most 
                            of their lives in eucalyptus trees, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves 
                            which are low in nutrients and toxic to many animals. To cope, koalas have a 
                            specialised digestive system that breaks down toxins and extracts nutrients slowly. 
                            They sleep up to 18 hours a day to conserve energy, as their diet provides limited 
                            calories. Koalas were once widespread along Australia’s eastern and southern coasts 
                            but have faced habitat loss due to urban expansion and deforestation.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Koalas are solitary and territorial, with each adult occupying a home range that 
                            contains several eucalyptus trees. They communicate through vocalisations such 
                            as bellows, which can carry over long distances during breeding season. Mothers 
                            carry their young, called joeys, in a pouch for about six months before the joey 
                            transitions to riding on her back. Koalas have sharp claws and strong limbs, 
                            making them excellent climbers. Conservation programs focus on protecting native 
                            habitats and managing diseases that threaten wild populations. Koalas are iconic 
                            symbols of Australia’s unique wildlife.
                            </p>

<p>
Koalas prefer open eucalyptus woodlands with plenty of mature trees for feeding 
and resting.

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the koalas at pen K03, next to the Australian Outback exhibit.</p>
