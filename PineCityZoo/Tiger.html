                        <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                        <p>
                            Tigers are the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
                            They are most recognisable for their dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur 
                            with a lighter underside. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on 
                            ungulates such as deer and wild boar. They are territorial and generally solitary 
                            but social animals, often marking their large territories with scent markings 
                            and scratch marks. Tigers once roamed throughout Asia but now occupy a fraction 
                            of their former range due to habitat loss and poaching. The Bengal tiger is the 
                            most numerous subspecies, while the Siberian tiger is the largest and most powerful.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Tigers have muscular bodies with powerful forelimbs, large heads and long tails. 
                            They possess sharp retractable claws that help them grab prey with precision. 
                            Their keen eyesight and night vision make them excellent nocturnal hunters. 
                            A tigerâ€™s roar can be heard up to 3 kilometres away and is used to communicate 
                            with other tigers over long distances. They are excellent swimmers and often 
                            cool off in ponds, lakes and rivers during hot weather. Some cultures consider 
                            the tiger a symbol of courage, strength and power, making it an iconic species 
                            in folklore and conservation.
                            </p>


                           <p>
                             Tigers inhabit diverse habitats including tropical forests, grasslands, 
                            and mangrove swamps. They need large territories with abundant prey and water.
