                        <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                       <p>
                            Elephants are the largest land mammals alive today, belonging to the family Elephantidae 
                            and the order Proboscidea. Two main species are recognised: the African elephant 
                            (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), with African bush 
                            and forest elephants sometimes listed as separate species. These gentle giants are 
                            found across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. They have played 
                            important roles in cultures, ecosystems, and conservation efforts worldwide.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Elephants are known for their long trunks, large ears, and massive tusks which they 
                            use for feeding, digging, and social interactions. Their trunks have thousands of 
                            muscles, making them incredibly versatile tools for grasping food and drinking water. 
                            Elephants live in tight family herds led by matriarchs and display complex social 
                            behaviours and remarkable memory. They are herbivorous and spend much of their day 
                            feeding on grasses, leaves, and fruits. Sadly, they face threats from habitat loss 
                            and poaching for ivory, making their protection critical.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Elephants live in savannahs, forests, marshes, and grasslands, always staying near water.

                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
