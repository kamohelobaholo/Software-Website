                        <h3>Giraffe</h3>
                        <p>
                            Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, instantly recognisable by their 
                            long necks and distinctive spotted coats. Their necks allow them to browse leaves 
                            and shoots high up in trees, mostly feeding on acacia species. A giraffe’s tongue 
                            can be up to 45 centimetres long and is tough enough to handle thorny branches. 
                            Giraffes live in loose herds without strong social bonds, and their keen eyesight 
                            helps them keep watch for predators like lions. Their height also makes them an 
                            important species for shaping vegetation in their habitat.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Each giraffe’s coat pattern is unique, much like a human fingerprint, and helps 
                            with camouflage in dappled light. Despite their size, giraffes move gracefully 
                            and can run up to 60 km/h over short distances. Males often compete in “necking” 
                            battles, swinging their necks and heads to establish dominance. Female giraffes 
                            give birth standing up, and newborn calves can stand and walk within hours. 
                            Giraffes are listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation but are 
                            protected in many reserves and zoos worldwide.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Giraffes inhabit savannahs, open woodlands, and grasslands with plenty of trees.

                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the giraffes at pen G09, beside the tall tree lookout area.</p>
