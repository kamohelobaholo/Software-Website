                        <h3>LION</h3>
                        <p>
                        Lions are large carnivorous mammals belonging to the genus Panthera and are 
                        commonly referred to as the "king of the jungle." They are the only cats that 
                        live in social groups called prides, which consist of related females, their 
                        offspring, and a small number of adult males. Male lions are easily recognised 
                        by their impressive manes, which vary in colour and size and serve as a display 
                        of health and strength. Historically, lions were found throughout Africa, the 
                        Middle East, and parts of Asia and Europe, but today they are mainly restricted 
                        to parts of sub-Saharan Africa and a small population in India known as the Asiatic lion.

                        <p>
                        Lions have strong muscular bodies with powerful jaws and sharp claws, making 
                        them formidable predators. They typically hunt large herbivores like zebras, 
                        wildebeest, and buffalo, working together to stalk and ambush prey. Female 
                        lions do most of the hunting, while males protect the prideâ€™s territory from 
                        intruders and rival males. Lions are known for their loud roars, which can 
                        carry up to 8 kilometres and help them communicate with other pride members. 
                        They spend a significant portion of the day resting and are most active during 
                        the cooler hours of dawn and dusk.

                        <p>
                        Lions prefer open savannahs, grasslands, and scrublands where prey is plentiful 
                        and water sources are accessible.

                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the lions at pen L08, close to the main safari lookout point.</p>
