                        <h3>PANDA</h3>
                        <p>
                        Giant pandas are large, bear-like mammals native to the mountainous regions 
                        of central China. They are easily recognised by their distinctive black and 
                        white fur pattern and their playful, gentle behaviour. Pandas primarily feed 
                        on bamboo, which makes up over 99% of their diet, although they may occasionally 
                        eat small mammals or carrion. Due to their specialised diet, pandas spend a 
                        large part of their day eating and resting. Once widespread throughout southern 
                        and eastern China, pandas are now classified as vulnerable, with conservation 
                        efforts helping to slowly increase their numbers in the wild.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Pandas have powerful jaws and strong molars to help them crush tough bamboo stalks. 
                        They are excellent climbers and often escape predators by ascending trees. Pandas 
                        are mostly solitary animals, marking their territory with scent glands and vocal 
                        calls to communicate. They give birth to tiny, helpless cubs that stay close to 
                        their mothers for up to two years. The giant panda is an international symbol 
                        of wildlife conservation and is beloved around the world for its unique appearance 
                        and gentle nature. Breeding programs and habitat protection have become crucial 
                        for their survival.

                        <p>
                        Pandas inhabit temperate forests with dense bamboo understories and access to 
                        fresh water.

                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the pandas at pen P05, near the bamboo garden walkway.</p>
