                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                        <p>
                            Gemsbok are large antelopes native to the arid regions and open plains of Southern Africa. 
                            They are famous for their long, straight, ringed horns that both males and females possess. 
                            Gemsbok have striking markings with a light grey body, black-and-white facial patterns, 
                            and contrasting dark stripes along their flanks and legs. They are well adapted to hot, 
                            dry climates and can survive long periods without direct water by obtaining moisture 
                            from the plants they eat.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            These antelopes live in herds ranging from small groups to larger gatherings depending 
                            on food availability. Gemsbok are grazers and browsers, feeding on grasses, roots, 
                            and wild melons. Their horns are used for self-defense against predators like lions 
                            and hyenas. Agile and alert, gemsbok can defend themselves fiercely when threatened. 
                            They are iconic animals in desert ecosystems and symbolise resilience and survival 
                            in some of Africaâ€™s harshest environments.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Gemsbok thrive in deserts, scrublands, and open plains where food and sparse water sources are found.
                            </p>

                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen GM06, near the desert trail exhibit.</p>
